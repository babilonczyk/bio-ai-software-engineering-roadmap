# Bio AI Software Engineer Roadmap – Your path to innovation ✨

Welcome to the Bio AI Software Engineer Roadmap - a no-fluff, hands-on guide for developers who want to build tools that matter in biology, AI, and biotech.

This isn’t just a list of buzzwords. It’s a map I’m actively using, learning from, and shaping as I go. If you’re tired of shallow tutorials and want to do real things with Python, proteins, and machine learning – you’re in the right place.

This roadmap grows with me, and hopefully with you too.

# Overview

**Bio AI Software Engineer** – a developer who builds intelligent software, tools, and infrastructure that apply machine learning to biological data, accelerating breakthroughs in protein design, drug discovery, and molecular simulation.

This roadmap is part of an ongoing journey documented at [**bioaisoftware.engineer**](https://bioaisoftware.engineer)

# Roadmap

## Stage 1 – Foundations

### Python Core  
Master Python, the primary language for AI and bioinformatics  

**Why?** Python is the universal glue in bioinformatics and AI. It’s readable, powerful, and supported by nearly every major data and bio library in the world.

→ [Python - Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
→ [Python Basics Course – KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/p/python-basics-course)  
→ [PCAP - Python Certification – KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/learning-path/python-certification)

### APIs & Backend  
Understand RESTful APIs, FastAPI, and backend development concepts  

**Why?** Backend APIs are how you’ll serve ML models, integrate databases, and let other scientists or tools use your results – whether from notebooks or production systems.  

→ [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

### Data Analysis & Visualization  
Learn NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization  

**Why?** You’ll constantly be exploring biological datasets. Pandas and NumPy help you reshape the data, while Matplotlib lets you see what matters. Think of them as your daily lab tools – but for data.  

→ [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)  
→ [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)  
→ [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)  
→ [Pandas - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)  
→ [Associate Data Scientist in Python – DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/career-tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python)  
→ [Data Scientist in Python – DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python)

### ML Basics  
Understand core ML concepts: regression, classification, overfitting, metrics  

**Why?** These are the core of any AI application. You’ll use these ideas whether predicting protein folding or modeling cell behavior. Without these fundamentals, nothing else works.  

→ [Intro to Machine Learning - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)  
→ [Intermediate Machine Learning - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)  
→ [Machine Learning Engineer – DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-engineer-with-python)  
→ [Machine Learning Scientist in Python – DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)  
→ [PyTorch - KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/pytorch)

### AI Concepts  
Learn about neural networks, deep learning, and AI ethics  

**Why?** Deep learning powers everything from AlphaFold to drug generation. Understanding layers, loss functions, and ethical implications makes you a responsible innovator.  

→ [Associate AI Engineer for Data Scientists – DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/associate-ai-engineer-for-data-scientists)

### Biology  
Basic understanding of molecular biology, DNA/RNA, and proteins  

**Why?** To make tools for biologists, you need to understand what they’re looking at. You don’t need a PhD, but you must grasp the fundamentals.  

→ [Khan Academy – Biology](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology)

### Git & GitHub Basics  
Version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub  

**Why?** Every real-world project — especially in science and open-source — uses Git. You’ll need it to share your work, collaborate, and build a portfolio.  

→ [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

### Linux / CLI Basics  
Basic command-line and shell scripting skills for bioinformatics pipelines  

**Why?** Many bioinformatics tools run in Linux terminals. Command-line skills save hours and let you work in cloud environments and HPC clusters.  

→ [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/)

## Stage 2 – Biology & Bioinformatics

### Molecular Biology  
Understand DNA, RNA, proteins, and gene expression  

**Why?** These are the building blocks of life — and data. If you want to build software to interpret biology, this is your blueprint.  

→ [Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Principles – Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/molecular-biology-and-biotechnology-principles/)

### Protein Structure  
Learn how proteins fold and function in 3D space  

**Why?** Structure determines function. Predicting or analyzing proteins is key to drug discovery, disease research, and biotech innovation.  

→ [Learn Bioinformatics From Scratch – Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-bioinformatics-from-scratch-theory-practical/)

### Tools & Pipelines  
Familiarity with bioinformatics tools like BLAST, FASTA, and sequence alignment  

**Why?** Bioinformatics is full of legacy tools — learn how they work and how to wrap or extend them with modern code. You’ll be the bridge between old and new.  

→ [Genomic Data Science Specialization – Coursera (JHU)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science)

### Biopython  
Python tools for computational biology and bioinformatics  

**Why?** This is your toolkit for working with sequences, structures, and biological file formats. Mastering it means writing clean, usable code for real workflows.  

→ [Biopython – Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/biopython/)
