# üß¨ Bio AI Software Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to the **Bio AI Software Engineer Roadmap** ‚Äî a practical and evolving learning path for developers at the intersection of software engineering, biology, and AI.

Whether you're an AI engineer entering biotech, a bioinformatician diving deeper into ML, or a developer curious about life science tools ‚Äî this roadmap gives you the real-world skills to build impactful software in biology.

Built and maintained alongside the live roadmap at [**bioaisoftware.engineer**](https://bioaisoftware.engineer)

## üß† What is a Bio AI Software Engineer?

A **Bio AI Software Engineer** builds intelligent tools, pipelines, and infrastructure for biological problems ‚Äî like protein folding, variant prediction, drug discovery, or lab automation. This includes:

- Writing production-ready Python and backend APIs
- Applying ML/AI to biological sequences and images
- Working with bioinformatics pipelines and HPC/cloud compute
- Making research workflows reproducible, interpretable, and scalable

They speak both the language of code and biology ‚Äî and often translate between worlds.

## üìö Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is split into **7 progressive stages**, each with hands-on projects and verified learning resources:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Stage 1** | Programming Foundations (Python, CLI, Git, clean code) |
| **Stage 2** | Software Engineering for Data & APIs (FastAPI, SQL, testing) |
| **Stage 3** | Data Literacy & ML (stats, sklearn, PyTorch, LLMs) |
| **Stage 4** | Biology & Bioinformatics Foundations (DNA, proteins, pipelines) |
| **Stage 5** | Bio-AI (Genomics, Proteomics, LLMs for Bio) |
| **Stage 6** | Data Engineering & MLOps (Snakemake, DVC, CI/CD, cloud) |
| **Stage 7** | Compliance, Reproducibility & Communication |

Each skill has:

- üîó Hand-picked courses or docs
